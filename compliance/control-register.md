## External residuals (status: external OR an external leg — visible, never faked as automated)

| Criterion | External owner | Why external |
|---|---|---|
| CC1.2 | board / leadership | no board in a small org; substituted by a recorded management review |
| CC4.2 | leadership/board (comms leg) | deficiency identification is human/agent judgment; board communication is external — watchdog only surfaces overdue cadence |
| CC6.1 | org GitHub/IdP admin (MFA enforcement) | substrate logical access is enforced; org-wide MFA on human accounts is an external IdP setting |
| CC6.4 | GitHub / Cloudflare | data-center physical security inherited; covered by their SOC2 |
| CC6.5 | subprocessor (media sanitization) | C14 covers transcript retention; full media/backup sanitization is procedure + subprocessor |
| CC6.8 | org IT / endpoint admin | supply-chain/pinning shrink malicious-dep surface; endpoint anti-malware/EDR is external |
| CC7.2 | org SecOps / SIEM | weekly snapshot + liveness != real-time anomaly detection; SIEM is external |
| CC9.1 | org/leadership (insurance) | cyber-insurance is an external policy |
| CC9.2 | org/legal (signed DPAs) | vendor risk is tracked in-repo; signing the legal DPAs with each subprocessor is external |

### Non-criterion residuals (the org owns these; not in-repo)

| Item | Owner | Why |
|---|---|---|
| CPA auditor engagement (Type I -> Type II report) | org/leadership | only a licensed CPA firm issues the SOC2 report |
| The Type-II observation window | time | ~3-12 months must elapse with evidence accruing; cannot be shortcut |
| Background-check execution | org/HR + screening vendor | external screening of real people |

## Honest limits (what this VISIBILITY system does and does not do)

- **Surfaced, not CI-enforced.** An overdue control opens a weekly `soc2-control-due` issue (re-opened every Monday while still overdue) — it does **not** fail CI or block merges. The currency gate hard-fails only in `check`/`soc2-register-check` (run on schedule + on register/ledger edits).
- **Cadence decay is machine-detected; evidence AUTHENTICITY is not.** `last` derives from ledger artifact timestamps, but the tool does not verify an artifact pointer resolves to a genuine snapshot. A fabricated `interval_end` reads current. The protection is change-management: `compliance/**` is a human-required path, so a forged ledger edit on a bot PR needs maintainer approval (it is review-gated, not machine-verified).
- **Fresh install grace.** With no artifacts yet, `last` = `effective_from` (the install date); a control is not overdue until its first interval elapses. Real Type-II evidence accrues over the observation window.
- **Correlated Actions-disable is a TERMINAL limit.** All surfacers (compliance-cadence, soc2-register-check, evidence-collect, heartbeat) are scheduled GitHub workflows. They cross-watch each other for an *individual* stall, but a *wholesale* Actions outage — GitHub auto-disabling schedules after 60 days of repo inactivity, an org disabling Actions, or archiving the repo — takes them all dark at once, and an in-repo watcher cannot survive its own Actions being disabled. Catching a full Actions outage requires **external** uptime/paging (org tooling), out of repo scope. This is disclosed, not prevented.
